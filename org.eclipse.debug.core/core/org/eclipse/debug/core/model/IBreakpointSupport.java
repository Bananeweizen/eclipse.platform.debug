/**
 * Breakpoint support defines functionality for
 * debug targets supporting breakpoints. The breakpoint manager
 * automatically adds debug targets as breakpoint listeners,
 * as launches are registered. The breakpoint
 * manager only informs a debug target of breakpoint changes
 * (that is, add/remove/change) if the target returns <code>true</code>
 * from <code>supportsBreakpoint(IMarker)</code>. The breakpoint manager
 * removes debug targets from its listener list as launches
 * are deregistered.
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
 * </p>
